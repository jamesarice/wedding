        <h1 class="display lead">Our day</h1>
          <p>Since getting engaged in September 2020 in the Lake District there’s been a lot of crazy planning going on. Some highs, lots of lows (thanks COVID!) and a date change later we can finally get excited about getting married!</p>

          <p>The day will be relaxed and not-so-formal, with good food being a big part of it &ndash; but most of all we’re looking forward to having all the important people in our lives together to make it a day to remember.</p>

          <p>Here’s the order of the day:</p>
          <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
            <tbody id="day-guests">
              <tr>
                <th><h2>Day guests</h2></th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>12.30</th>
                <td>Small ceremony with close family</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>2.30</th>
                <td>Feast and drinks</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>3.30</th>
                <td>Speeches and dessert</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>
            <tbody id="evening-guests">
              <tr>
                <th><h2>Evening guests</h2></th>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>From 5</th>
                <td>We welcome all our wonderful friends and family to celebrate with us</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>Early evening</th>
                <td>Cocktails and good grub</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <th>Later</th>
                <td>Drinks and dancing with live music</td>

          <p>Not only have the team won awards for their food, the venue is exactly what we were looking for. It’s intimate, set in a beautiful location and something a little bit different.</p>

          <h1 class="display lead">Getting here</h1>
          <p>The venue is in the Peak District, so travelling by car is likely the best way to get here.</p>

Please note: the car parks are free, but overnight parking is not permitted. <a href="http://www.alstonefield.org/tourist-info/car-parking/" target="_blank">Read more about parking on the Alstonefield community website</a>.</p>
          <p>For evening guests: parking in the village is limited so you are best to arrange a taxi from your accommodation.</p>

          <h1 class="display lead">Children</h1>
          <p>Unfortunately, since we originally expected a very small wedding based on the restrictions at the time, the venue capacity means we’re unable to extend invitations to children. So time to let your hair down and have a night off!</p>

        <section>
          <h1 class="display lead">Food and drink</h1>
          <p>We’re in the process of designing our menu. We plan on predominantly vegetable-based dishes.
